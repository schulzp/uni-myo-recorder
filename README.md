Crimp Bit Analysis Tool
=======================

## IDE & Setup

I recommend JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA. Simply import the root project in this folder.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple modules:

* **`core`** application core providing the required services
* **`cli`** command line interface

## Running

Make sure the Myo Connector is running and a device is connected. Then launch `Analysis.main()`.
