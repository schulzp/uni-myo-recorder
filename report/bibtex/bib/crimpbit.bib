	Abstract = {Objectives---To determine the frequency of overuse injury in indoor climbers, the common sites of such injury, and the factors that influence the probability that a climber will have sustained an overuse injury while climbing indoors.Method---A semisupervised questionnaire was used to survey overuse injury in 295 spectators and competitors at the Entre-Prises World Climbing Championships held in Birmingham 3--5 December 1999. Statistical analysis included simple cross tabulations, calculation of odds ratios, and multiple logistic regression to explore the effect of several factors simultaneously.Results---Some 44% of respondents had sustained an overuse injury, 19% at more than one site. The most common site of injury was the fingers. Univariate analysis showed that the probability of having sustained a climbing injury is higher in men (p = 0.009), those who have climbed for more than 10 years (p = 0.006), those who climb harder routes (p<0.0005), and those who boulder or lead more than they top rope (p<0.0005). The relation between lead grade and climbing injury is linear. Multivariate analysis removed the effect of sex as an independent predictor.Conclusions---Many climbers sustain overuse injury. The most at risk are those with the most ability and dedication to climbing. Climbers should be aware of the risk factors that influence injury and be able to spot the signs and symptoms of injury once they occur. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Recently, sport climbing has become popular throughout the world. Sport climbing is an extreme sport where people climb an artificial wall with various artificial holds using their hands and feet. Technique training related to using hands and feet is necessary for novice climbers, hence we need effective training contents. The purpose of this research is to analyze postures and movements in sport climbing using Microsoft Kinect for realistic 3D climbing animations. A professional male climber participated in this research in order to obtain good movements for the animations. We divided a climbing cycle into four phase and analyzed each phase. The posture and movement data in sport climbing which are analyzed through this research will be used to make realistic 3D character animation. },

	Abstract = {An important component of many data mining projects is finding a good classification algorithm, a process that requires very careful thought about experimental design. If not done very carefully, comparative studies of classification and other types of algorithms can easily result in statistically invalid conclusions. This is especially true when one is using data mining techniques to analyze very large databases, which inevitably contain some statistically unlikely data. This paper describes several phenomena that can, if ignored, invalidate an experimental comparison. These phenomena and the conclusions that follow apply not only to classification, but to computational experiments in almost any aspect of data mining. The paper also discusses why comparative analysis is more important in evaluating some types of algorithms than for others, and provides some suggestions about how to avoid the pitfalls suffered by many experimental studies.},
